/**
 * AVLTree must be a subclass of BinarySearchTree<E> and must use
 * inheritance and calls to superclass methods to avoid unnecessary
 * duplication or copying of functionality.
 * <p>
 * 1. Create a subclass of BSTNode, perhaps named AVLNode.
 * 2. Override the insert method such that it creates AVLNode instances
 * instead of BSTNode instances.
 * 3. Do NOT "replace" the children array in BSTNode with a new
 * children array or left and right fields in AVLNode.  This will
 * instead mask the super-class fields (i.e., the resulting node
 * would actually have multiple copies of the node fields, with
 * code accessing one pair or the other depending on the type of
 * the references used to access the instance).  Such masking will
 * lead to highly perplexing and erroneous behavior. Instead,
 * continue using the existing BSTNode children array.
 * 4. Ensure that the class does not have redundant methods
 * 5. Cast a BSTNode to an AVLNode whenever necessary in your AVLTree.
 * This will result a lot of casts, so we recommend you make private methods
 * that encapsulate those casts.
 * 6. Do NOT override the toString method. It is used for grading.
 * 7. The internal structure of your AVLTree (from this.root to the leaves) must be correct
